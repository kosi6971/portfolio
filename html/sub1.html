                <p>
                    The late 20th century manifestation of welfare<br>
                    capitalism spread outwards from post-war<br>
                    America into western democracies across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system of merit-based mobility, which concerned itself with ensuring corporate<br>
                    productivity whilst also maintaining a social safety net, improved the standard of<br>
                    living for so many, boosting both prosperity and productivity, whilst also reducing<br>
                    economic inequality to the lowest levels in recorded history. It ushered in an age of<br>
                    modernisation, liberalisation, labour rights and technological democratisation all<br>
                    justified by extraordinary economic growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new era of distributed prosperity relied on the idea that social mobility was<br>
                    effectively guaranteed to those who were educated, worked hard and abided by<br>
                    the laws of the land. Income became a proxy for economic value, work ethic,<br>
                    effectiveness, ingenuity, knowledge and influence. It was through the creation of<br>
                    economic value that people ascended the social ladder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new era of distributed<br>
                    prosperity relied on the idea that<br>
                    social mobility was effectively<br>
                    guaranteed to those who were<br>
                    educated, worked hard and abided by the laws of the land.</p>
                <p>
                    The corporation was the vehicle through which the worker could achieve social mobility. Notionally, the corporation should ignore prevailing societal prejudice and discrimination in search of profits so it was well placed to assess those characteristics. It was effective for 60 years. For the first time in history, a person born poor had no restrictions placed on their potential. The social contract that the leaders of the early 20th century had begun to embroider was flourishing. Welfare<br>
                    capitalism had proven to be both the most effective and equitable<br>
                    economic system ever created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system was not without faults. Systemic misogyny and malignant racism<br>
                    were baked into the institutions tasked with administering, regulating and<br>
                    managing the economy. This manifested in such profound and extreme levels of<br>
                    social and economic exclusion that it has shaped much of the social discourse of today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welfare capitalism was severely flawed but it provided a basis upon which a more<br>
                    equitable society could exist. One where the interests of citizen and corporation<br>
                    could cohabitate. But wars, recessions and rapid financial internationalisation<br>
                    created unstoppable momentum in another direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 80’s brought with it an era of political ideology called neoliberalism. Neoliberal<br>
                    doctrine argues that humanity flourishes most when the owners of capital maximise<br>
                    profits. The resulting policy decisions included enormous deregulation of financial<br>
                    markets, the widespread privatisation of state-owned assets and the minimisation<br>
                    of labour representation. Corporations were more profitable than ever, but those<br>
                    profits were no longer distributed in an equitable manner, causing a rapid worsening<br>
                    of economic inequality. Investors, the providers of capital, were being<br>
                    disproportionately rewarded when compared to employees, the creators of value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Massive quantitative easing post 2008 exacerbated that dynamic. Inflation<br>
                    manifested principally in asset prices. Real estate prices, stock markets, venture<br>
                    capital and private equity experienced a decade of extraordinary growth. Those who<br>
                    owned assets benefited, whilst those who did not saw them become less accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time as this vast recalibration of the distribution of wealth within<br>
                    advanced industrial economies, taxation regimes in many nations have grown<br>
                    increasingly regressive and imbalanced. In particular, the taxation of high earners<br>
                    has evolved dramatically since the end of the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The top marginal income tax rates in the United States and the United Kingdom in<br>
                    the 1970s were above 70 percent. The Reagan and Thatcher regimes led to rate<br>
                    cuts of 40 percentage points for the wealthiest citizens within a decade. Equitable<br>
                    systems of taxation ensure that those at the bottom can more rapidly ascend<br>
                    economic classes through access to better infrastructure and resources.

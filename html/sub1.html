                <h2>La Vie en Rose</h2>
                <p>
                    The late 20th century manifestation of welfare<br>
                    capitalism spread outwards from post-war<br>
                    America into western democracies across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system of merit-based mobility, which concerned itself with ensuring corporate<br>
                    productivity whilst also maintaining a social safety net, improved the standard of<br>
                    living for so many, boosting both prosperity and productivity, whilst also reducing<br>
                    economic inequality to the lowest levels in recorded history. It ushered in an age of<br>
                    modernisation, liberalisation, labour rights and technological democratisation all<br>
                    justified by extraordinary economic growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new era of distributed prosperity relied on the idea that social mobility was<br>
                    effectively guaranteed to those who were educated, worked hard and abided by<br>
                    the laws of the land. Income became a proxy for economic value, work ethic,<br>
                    effectiveness, ingenuity, knowledge and influence. It was through the creation of<br>
                    economic value that people ascended the social ladder.
                </p>
                <p>

                    The new era of distributed<br>
                    prosperity relied on the idea that<br>
                    social mobility was effectively<br>
                    guaranteed to those who were<br>
                    educated, worked hard and abided by the laws of the land.</p>
                <p>
                    The corporation was the vehicle through which the worker could achieve social mobility. Notionally, the<br>
                    corporation should ignore prevailing<br>
                    societal prejudice and discrimination in<br>
                    search of profits so it was well placed to<br>
                    assess those characteristics. It was<br>
                    effective for 60 years. For the first time<br>
                    in history, a person born poor had no<br>
                    restrictions placed on their potential. The<br>
                    social contract that the leaders of the<br>
                    early 20th century had begun to<br>
                    embroider was flourishing. Welfare<br>
                    capitalism had proven to be both the most effective and equitable<br>
                    economic system ever created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system was not without faults. Systemic misogyny and malignant racism<br>
                    were baked into the institutions tasked with administering, regulating and<br>
                    managing the economy. This manifested in such profound and extreme levels of<br>
                    social and economic exclusion that it has shaped much of the social discourse of today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welfare capitalism was severely flawed but it provided a basis upon which a more<br>
                    equitable society could exist. One where the interests of citizen and corporation<br>
                    could cohabitate. But wars, recessions and rapid financial internationalisation<br>
                    created unstoppable momentum in another direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 80’s brought with it an era of political ideology called neoliberalism. Neoliberal<br>
                    doctrine argues that humanity flourishes most when the owners of capital maximise<br>
                    profits. The resulting policy decisions included enormous deregulation of financial<br>
                    markets, the widespread privatisation of state-owned assets and the minimisation<br>
                    of labour representation. Corporations were more profitable than ever, but those<br>
                    profits were no longer distributed in an equitable manner, causing a rapid worsening<br>
                    of economic inequality. Investors, the providers of capital, were being<br>
                    disproportionately rewarded when compared to employees, the creators of value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Massive quantitative easing post 2008 exacerbated that dynamic. Inflation<br>
                    manifested principally in asset prices. Real estate prices, stock markets, venture<br>
                    capital and private equity experienced a decade of extraordinary growth. Those who<br>
                    owned assets benefited, whilst those who did not saw them become less accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time as this vast recalibration of the distribution of wealth within<br>
                    advanced industrial economies, taxation regimes in many nations have grown<br>
                    increasingly regressive and imbalanced. In particular, the taxation of high earners<br>
                    has evolved dramatically since the end of the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The top marginal income tax rates in the United States and the United Kingdom in<br>
                    the 1970s were above 70 percent. The Reagan and Thatcher regimes led to rate<br>
                    cuts of 40 percentage points for the wealthiest citizens within a decade. Equitable<br>
                    systems of taxation ensure that those at the bottom can more rapidly ascend<br>
                    economic classes through access to better infrastructure and resources.

                <p>
                    Economic class is a concept familiar to many.<br>
                    Most people identify as part of a particular<br>
                    class, be it poor, working class, middle class,<br>
                    upper-middle class or upper class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an identifier that shapes the way we view the world and the opportunities<br>
                    and challenges it presents. It often determines the company we keep, the<br>
                    employment we pursue, the values we hold close and the environments in which<br>
                    we feel comfortable. Few social constructs influence the parameters we<br>
                    construct around ourselves and our potential more than economic class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This traditional class framework becomes increasingly redundant as the gap<br>
                    between rich and poor grows and upward social mobility decelerates. There is<br>
                    less to distinguish poor from working class from middle class than there has<br>
                    been at any point in the last century. These three classes in particular are<br>
                    significantly less distinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The internet and entertainment media have degraded the knowledge gap<br>
                    between these groups.. We can see how “the other half” lives. Education has<br>
                    diminished the skills gap and the economy has degraded the pay gap to the<br>
                    extent that a college degree will no longer entitle someone to higher lifetime<br>
                    earnings than someone without.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heritage and inherited status means less for class than ever before. The primary<br>
                    determinants of contemporary class are income and wealth. Do you have<br>
                    sufficient income that you can acquire wealth and do you have sufficient wealth<br>
                    that you do not require income generated through work? Will you accumulate<br>
                    debt or wealth over the course of a working life?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional socio-economic divisions, determined by<br>
                    heritage, race and geography, are far less pronounced<br>
                    than they once were. In their place have risen new<br>
                    economic classes defined by wealth alone. We have<br>
                    tried to classify this new economic framework in<br>
                    terms of income and wealth, showcasing how wealth<br>
                    accumulation at the top makes social mobility more<br>
                    difficult for those at the bottom.

                    They’d been let down so often, Their brow was on the<br>
                    floor, But then they found a small hole, And let them<br>
                    down some more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When looking for the drivers of downward social mobility, a recurring theme arises: both economists and sociologists agree on the fact that it is usually the result of “unexpected stressful life events”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the social contract of welfare capitalism were being upheld, the negative impact of unexpected life events should be mitigated by a safety net that ensures one can quickly return to being a net contributor to the economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the evidence clearly shows that these unexpected shocks, typically unrelated to individual merit, are the primary drivers of downward mobility. Jessi Streib writes, “The common story about downward mobility is one of bad luck: recent generations have the misfortune of coming of age during an economic downturn, a student debt crisis, declining job security, and, now, a pandemic.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above examples focus on social disruptions, but stressful life events can also come from a personal situation. For instance, divorce or health problems can also be drivers of downward social mobility. More precisely, a stressful life event on its own won’t necessarily result in downward social mobility, given that not everyone is affected by stressful life events in the same way. Rather, it has to come with the lack of a financial safety net. Faced with these challenges, many turn instead to a “debt safety net”, which becomes essential to household functioning but which can lead to a cycle of compounding losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bad luck can be exacerbated or mitigated by demographic factors. It is clear that intellect, work ethic and attitude have far less to do with social mobility than do race, gender, disability or inheritance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inheritance
                </p>
                <p>
                    The promise of welfare capitalism, oft-referred to as the “American Dream” is the idea that any citizen, regardless of birth, can climb to the highest perch of politics, commerce or professional life based on merit alone. This concept spread throughout the developed world, validating the economic ascent of millions who had climbed the social ladder from lower classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has become a central tenet of contemporary democracy. Discriminatory systemic or cultural barriers to upward social mobility are seen as anathema to civil society. Yet despite that, we continue to facilitate massive transfers of wealth through inheritance.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Most wealth is inherited – up to 65% in the US, by some accounts. This is determinative in a world where assets, not income, define economic class. It also has a material impact on those from lower classes who exhibit merit, work ethic and positive attitude. The likelihood that they will experience upward
                </p>
                <p>
                    social mobility is significantly reduced due to their inability to access assets through income alone. In the UK, for example, whilst some may have the educational credentials and occupational prospects that correspond to established

                <p>
                    understandings of what constitutes the middle class, an explosion in property prices relative to income means there is little prospect of owning a middle-class home without access to family wealth.

                    It is increasingly the case that the income category of one’s parents is likely to have a significant impact on the probability that any one individual will experience social mobility. The relation between income inequality and social mobility is a longitudinal concern, the fear being that those with more significant incomes will have a greater capacity to accrue wealth (e.g. savings, assets) whilst those on lower incomes will be unable to do so. As with the impact of education, this would imply a disruption of social mobility through mechanisms of inherited wealth when taken to an intergenerational scale. This process is a demonstration of how differences in income or asset value can compound over time.

                    The role of inherited wealth is forecast to become even more important in the future. According to the Nuffield Foundation, inheritance will represent 8% of average lifetime earnings for those born in the 1960s, whereas this will rise to 14% for those born in the 1980s. However, inheritance alone is not the only answer, given that inheritance primarily serves to benefit those who are already wealthy. As argued by Marc Szydik, “Future inheritances will continue to substantially increase the discrepancies between economic classes”.

                <p>
                    Declining social mobility has a severe and cumulative impact on all of those who hoped, one day, for something better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People are coming to terms with the idea that life is unlikely to improve substantially with age, retirement is likely to be very challenging and their kids are unlikely to be better off than they are. This is cultivating higher levels of social malcontent, frustration and inequity, which is manifesting as activism and protest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research demonstrates that people who have experienced social mobility are more likely to justify or support the status quo. The same also holds true for those who perceive social mobility to be possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The converse is also the case. In the US, for example, perceived stagnation in upward social mobility is rising and is seen as a motivator for former President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016, as well as for the storming of the US Capitol in January 2021. Elsewhere, surveys reveal that 87% of French “Yellow Vest” protestors express the feeling of living in an unfair society. In the UK, an increase in intergenerational immobility has been linked to transformative political schisms, such as the country’s 2016 Brexit vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These patterns are reproduced on a global scale, a key indicator of the fact that declining beliefs about the possibility of social mobility open up a space for political turbulence and for societal change. Although there may be variations in the suggested routes to achieving increased social mobility, commentary and insights from across the political spectrum and in various national contexts come to the same conclusions: ensuring a freely moving social elevator is one of the most powerful mechanisms for ensuring social cohesion and political stability.

                    Keynes was correct. The accumulation of capital and scientific advances has indeed afforded people the opportunity to live a life in pursuit of leisure, without obligation or necessity for labour, but that reality extends to only a small few within an emerging economic aristocracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keynes, wrongly, assumed that nations would act collectively to ensure that the pursuit of capital for satisfaction alone would be disabused until the burden of necessity was lifted for all. Instead, the system has facilitated the accumulation of extreme wealth for a small minority, for whom the contribution of labour is now optional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those without capital, salaried income is now considerably less effective as a mechanism for prosperity. Nevertheless, it has now been clearly established that technology and the compounded accumulation of capital can actually relieve people of the necessity of work and provide to them the opportunity for a life free of laborious obligation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology was to be our saviour. The vehicle through which “we would come to value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful”. Perhaps it will yet be. For now, the uneven distribution of technology, technological capital and technological skills has created unprecedented opportunities for individuals and challenges for an economic system predicated on a social contract that is no longer effective. The next section will explore the ways in which new economies are forming around digital endeavour and the consequences for economic class in the digital age.

                    “The time for all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.”

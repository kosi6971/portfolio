                    faced with his real, his permanent problem — how to <br>
                    use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how <br>
                    to occupy the leisure, which science and compound <br>

                    agreeably and well.” </p>

                <p class="txt2"> JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES. </p>

                <p class="txt3"> ECONOMIC POSSIBILITIES for OUR GRANDCHILDREN, 1928 </p>

                <p class="txt4"> Almost a century past, John Maynard Keynes, the great Cambridge economist, <br>
                    predicted that the children of the 21st century would work no more than 15 hours a <br>
                    week. His belief was founded upon the idea that the accumulation of capital, <br>
                    accelerated by technological efficiencies, would generate productivity that far <br>
                    exceeded the consumption of necessities.</p>

                <p class="txt5"> This utopian future seemed achievable for much of the 20th century. Technological <br>
                    advances pulled billions out of poverty, extended life expectancy, and put humans on <br>
                    the moon. Upon a foundation of science and technology a contract was built that promised that <br>
                    prosperity was guaranteed for all those who became educated, <br>
                    worked hard and obeyed the laws of the land. We referred to this process of <br>
                    prosperity as social mobility. </p>

                <p class="txt6"> That exchange has become radically distorted. Asset <br>
                    inflation and falling yields have ensured that home <br>
                    ownership, long-term financial wellness and <br>
                    economic prosperity are unattainable goals for most <br>
                    college graduates in today's developed world. The <br>
                    frustration caused by this corruption in the social <br>
                    contract has manifested as cultural protests and <br>
                    political activism the world over in a form that is likely <br>
                    to last for decades. </p>

                <p class="txt7"> Economic inequality is at the heart of many of society's most challenging problems. <br>
                    It pervades every aspect of civic discourse, social interactions and cultural <br>
                    institutions. The gap between rich and poor is widening and the likelihood of <br>
                    becoming upwardly mobile, based on salary alone, is lessening. This will continue to <br>
                    have profound consequences for our economic systems and social unrest fomented <br>
                    by systemic inequity. This is an investigation into the ways in which technology <br>
                    exacerbates and sometimes mitigates those issues. We’ll consider how inequitable <br>
                    systems of social mobility are a predictor of future fragility and we’ll consider some of <br>
                    the possible solutions to this extraordinary problem. </p>
